This is an animation of a chrome & brass robot arm playing the "towers of
Hanoi".  The objective is to move the discs from one peg to another, with
the stipulations that you may only move one at a time, and you may only move
a disc onto one that is larger.

This is one of those classical problems that you get assigned in a programming
class.  Espically Pascal, where the professors delight in assigning programs
that do lots of recursion.

Every frame in the animation was generated from a Polyray v1.5 data file.  The
final FLI was created using DTA.  I know there are still a few bugs in the
movement.  However the motions of the arm and hand contain a number of elements
that lend to the realism of the scene.

Enjoy, Xander
