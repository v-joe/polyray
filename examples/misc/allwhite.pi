// This file is use to create the grid for "chain.pi".  The whole reason
// for this file is to create a 32x32 greyscale Targa that has the value
// one in every pixel.  This is achieved by tracing a background that
// is set to 1/255 in every channel (which turns into the value 1 in the
// eight bit representation of a color).  By setting the pixelsize to 8,
// and turning off RLE compression we can generate a greyscale Targa
// appropriate for use in a gridded object
